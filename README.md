# Getting Started with KubeVela with AKS

KubeVela is a modern application delivery platform designed to make deploying and operating applications across hybrid and multi-cloud environments easier, faster, and more reliable.
And KubeVela is built on top of Kubernetes and provides a set of abstractions and tools that simplify the process of deploying, managing, and scaling applications.

## Main Benefits of KubeVela
- Simplifies application deployment across different environments
- Provides consistent delivery experience
- Supports hybrid and multi-cloud deployments
- Makes application operations more reliable
- Offers extensible and programmable workflows

## Description

### 1. Core Features

- **Infrastructure agnostic**: Works across different cloud providers and environments
- **Application-centric**: Focuses on application delivery rather than infrastructure management
- **Programmable**: Allows customization and automation of delivery workflows
- **Built on Kubernetes**: Leverages Kubernetes as its control plane
- **Open Application Model (OAM) based**: Uses OAM for application definition and orchestration

### 2. Open Application Model (OAM)\
OAM is a specification for defining and deploying applications in a cloud-native environment. It provides a set of abstractions and APIs that allow developers to describe their applications in a way that is independent of the underlying infrastructure.
OAM defines three main concepts:
- **Components**: The building blocks of an application, such as microservices, databases, and message queues.
- **Traits**: Additional functionality that can be applied to components, such as scaling, monitoring, and logging.
- **Scopes**: The environment in which the application is deployed, such as a Kubernetes cluster or a cloud provider.
